## Description
**Basic Blackjack** is a digital recreation of the classic casino card game, Blackjack. The objective is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a total of 21. 

I chose to develop this game because I wanted to master complex conditional logic and explore the challenges of managing a deck of cards through JavaScript state.

## Getting Started
*   **Play the Game:** [Basic Blackjack](https://zigy-twotoes.github.io/blackjack-ga-project-1/)
*   **Planning Materials:** [Project Development](./PROJECTIDEA.md)

### How to Play:
1.  Click **"Deal"** to start the game.
2.  Choose **"Hit"** to receive another card or **"Stand"** to lock in your current score.
3.  The Dealer must hit until they reach at least 17.
4.  Win by getting closer to 21 than the dealer without "busting" (going over 21).

## Technologies Used
*   **HTML5:** Structured the game board and UI elements.
*   **CSS3:** Styled the table, buttons, and responsive layout.
*   **JavaScript (ES6):** Handled game logic, card shuffling, and DOM updates.
