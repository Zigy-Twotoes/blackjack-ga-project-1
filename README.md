Card Values
Number Cards (2–10): Count as their face value.
Face Cards (Jack, Queen, King): Each counts as 10.
Aces: Can count as either 1 or 11, whichever benefits the hand more. 

Standard Gameplay Flow
Initial Deal: Every player and the dealer receive two cards. Most often, the dealer has one card face up (upcard) and one card face down (hole card).
Natural (Blackjack): If your first two cards are an Ace and a 10-value card, you have a "Blackjack" (natural 21).
Player Decisions: Starting from the dealer's left, you choose one of two primary actions:
Hit: Take another card to increase your total. You can hit as many times as you like until you reach 21 or "bust".
Stand: Keep your current hand and end your turn.
Busting: If your hand total exceeds 21, you "bust" and lose immediately, regardless of the dealer's hand. 

Dealer’s Fixed Rules 
Must Hit: The dealer must hit if their hand total is 16 or lower.
Must Stand: The dealer must stand once their total is 17 or higher.
Win: You win if your total is higher than the dealer's without going over 21, or if the dealer busts and you did not.
Loss: You lose if your total is lower than the dealer's, or if you bust.
Push (Tie): If your total and the dealer's total are the same, it is a "push" (no winner or loser).
